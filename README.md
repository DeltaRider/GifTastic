# GifTastic
Assignment number 6 for UC Berkeley Extension's Full Stack Development Bootcamp.

There were a few requirements I forwent on purpose, not because of difficulty or inability, but becasue it wasn't a desired functionality for me.  This includes the following:

1. Starting and stopping gifs with a click.
2. Showing the rating of the gif on the page.

I plan to personally use this site, and like to have the gif's playing when I choose a button.  I don't want to have to click every gif to watch it play.

Also, the g/pg rating was uneccessary and made the site look ugly.  No need for that information.
